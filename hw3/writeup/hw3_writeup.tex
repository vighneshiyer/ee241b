\section{Building and Characterizing a Standard Cell}

\subsection{Flow and Decoder Delay Using Custom Cell}
We go through the tutorial to design a custom NAND2 standard cell. We first record the critical path of the 3-8 decoder used in the previous lab with the NAND2 cell supplied with the design kit. The critical path goes from \verb|A[3]| to \verb|Z[5]| and it has a delay of 0.1376 ns.

We then tell DC and ICC to use our custom standard cell and we measure the critical path again. The critical path now goes from \verb|A[0]| to \verb|Z[14]| and has a delay of 0.1019 ns, which is an improvement over the previous ICC run. However, looking at the final Verilog netlist from ICC only 2 instances of our \verb|NAND2X1B_RVT| cell exist. However, after running only DC, there were many instances of our custom cell. It seems that ICC did some optimization and swapped out most of those custom cells for standard cells from the design kit.

\subsection{Standard Cell Inverter Variation Impact vs $V_{DD}$}
We run a 300 point Monte Carlo simulation and plot the mean and sigma for the input-rising/output-falling delay of the \verb|INVX0_RVT| standard cell for $V_{DD}$ between 0.2 and 1.05. We fix an input slope of 10ps and a 1fF load. This part was done by exporting a netlist from Virtuoso and using commandline HSPICE for the simulation.

We then plot $\sigma / \mu$ vs. $V_{DD}$.

Finally we plot the delay of a $6 \sigma$ cell relative to the mean vs. $V_{DD}$.
